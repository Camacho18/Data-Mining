What does glm?
glm is used to fit generalized linear models, specified by
a symbolic description of the linear predictor and a description of the distribution of the
error.
glm returns a class object inherited from "glm" which inherits from class "lm".
glm.fit is the function of the workhorse: it is not normally called directly,
but it can be more efficient when the response vector, the design matrix and the
family have already been calculated.
The summary function (i.e. summary.glm) can be used to get or
print a summary of the results and the anova function (i.e. anova.glm) to
produce an analysis of variance table.
The generic access functions coefficients, effects, fitted.values ​​and
residuals can be used to extract various useful characteristics from the value
returned by glm.
An object of class "glm" is a list containing at least the following
components:
● coefficients
a named vector of coefficients
● residual copyright
the residuals of work, i.e. the residuals in the final iteration of the fit
IWLS. Since zero weight cases are omitted, your work residuals
they are NA.
● adjusted values
the adjusted mean values, obtained by transforming the predictors
linear by the inverse of the link function.
● range
The numerical range of the fitted linear model.
● family
The family object used.
