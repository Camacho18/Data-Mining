Split Ratio () and lm ()
Generally, although the data you want to work with is given in
Tables are not organized in the way intended to work on them.
function split (), allows classifying data, typically given as a vector, or
like a data frame.
Splitting ratio:
● if (0 <= splitratio <1) <code = ""> then SplitRatio fraction of points from Y
will be set to true
● if (SplitRatio == 1) then one random point from Y will be set to True
● if (SplitRatio> 1) then SplitRatio number of points from Y will be set to
True

lm ()
Used to fit linear models can be used to carry out
regression, single-stratum analysis of variance and covariance analysis.
Models for lm are specified symbolically.
lm returns an object of class "lm" or for multiple class responses
c ("mlm", "lm").
An object of class "lm" is a list containing at least the following
components:
● coefficients
a named vector of coefficients
● residual copyright
the residuals, that is, the answer minus the adjusted values.
● adjusted values
adjusted mean values
● range
The numerical range of the fitted linear model.
● weights
(for weighted adjustments only) the specified weights.
● df.residual
The residual degrees of freedom.
● call
the matching call
● conditions

The terms object used.
● contrasts
(only where relevant) the contrasts used.
● xlevels
(only where relevant) a record of factor levels
used in adjustment.
● compensate
the offset used (missing if none were used).
● and
if requested, the response used.
● X
if requested, the model matrix used.
● model
if requested (the default), the frame of the model used.
● na.action
(where applicable) information returned by model.frame about handling
NA special.
Also, nonzero settings will have assigned components, effects and (unless
not requested) qr related to linear adjustment, for use by functions
extractors as summary and effects.
