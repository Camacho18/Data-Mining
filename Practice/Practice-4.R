#Dear Student,
#
#Welcome to the dataset for the homework exercise.
#
#Instructions for this dataset:
# You have only been supplied vectors. You will need
# to create the matrices yourself.
# Matrices:
# - FreeThrows
# - FreeThrowAttempts

#Seasons are labeled based on the first year in the season
#E.g. the 2012-2013 season is preseneted as simply 2012
