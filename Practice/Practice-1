Try the *Law of Large Numbers* for N random numbers normally distributed with mean = 0, stdev = 1: 
Create an R script that counts how many of these numbers fall between -1 and 1 and divide by the total amount of N 
You know that E (X) = 68.2% 
Verify the mean (Xn) -> E (X) while running your script again while increasing N Innuendo: 
-Initialize sample size 
-Initialize counter loop for (i in rnorm (size)) 
-Check if the iterated variable falls 
-Increase the counter if the condition is true return a result <- counter / N



size <- 99999999
cont <- 0
mean <- 0
stdev <- 1
for(i in rnorm(size,mean,stdev)){
  if(i>=-1 && i<=1)
    cont <- cont+1
}
result <- cont/size
result <- result*100
paste(format(round(result, 2), nsmall = 2),"%")
